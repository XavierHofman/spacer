            <h2>Sun</h2>
            <p>We all know the big shiny ball floating in the sky. Giving us light and warmth - crucial for life on
                earth.</p>
            <p>It's basically a giant lava ball in the middle of our solar system. All planets orbit around the sun.
                It's radiation is extremely lethal, but luckily we have some protection around our planet to prevent us
                all from dying of radiation.</p>

            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p>The planet closest to the sun. If you think summers are hot, it's advisable to not visit Mercury.</p>
            <p>Besides being the closest to the sun, this is also the smallest planet in our solar system. It's close
                distance to the sun also makes this planet orbit the sun the fastest.</p>
            <p>It's named after the Roman god Mercurius, because Mercurius was also fast or something.</p>

            <p>This is the second closest planet to the sun. Also one of the nearest to our own planet.</p>
            <p>Because it is so close to us, it's also the brightest visible planet together with our moon! You can see
                it with your bare eyes.</p>
            <p>Just don't stare at the sky too long because that's not good for your neck.</p>

            <p>Good ol' planet Earth. This is where all the magic happens!</p>
            <p>We have all been here at some point in our lives. Some might stay here forever. Others might travel to the next planet.</p>
            <p>Currently the only planet of which we are sure it has living beings! But it would be silly to assume it's the only one...</p>

            <p>Also known as the Red Giant. This is our other neighbouring planet.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, it is not as bright as Venus, so much harder to see with bare eyes. It is also a tad smaller than earth.</p>
            <p>Some say humans originally come from Mars. Will we ever know for sure? We will see.</p>
            <p>If you're lucky, you might live seeing the first humans stepping on Mars, or at least witness the beginning of their journey. <br>

            <p>This one is really.... Gassy. Unlike the planets you have seen so far, this one does not have a solid surface!</p>
            <p>That's why we call them 'gas giants'. Despite consisting only of gas, this is the biggest one in our solar system.
                Don't light your cigarette near this one or you might not survive your visit.</p>

            <p>A planet made of... gas! Did it steal the idea of its neighbor? If you know, let me know.</p>
            <p>This planet has the most visible rings around it. During pre-historic times, this planet was already spotted.
                <br>Did you know Saturn has 82 moons orbiting it?</p>

            <p>Have you ever seen Uranus? No, I mean the planet, silly. </p>
            <p>This planet is covered in ice! The average temperature reaches as low as -210&deg;C (or -346&deg;F for the silly imperials).</p>
            <p>If you like your beers cold, this seems to be more effective than your freezer.</p>

            <p>Named after the Greek God of the sea: Neptune. Have these Greek folks taken over our solar system?</p>
            <p>The core consists of molten rocks and metals, surrounded by stone, water, amoniac, and methane. The methane give this planet a bright blue color.<br>
            Looks pretty cool to me!</p>
            <p>Fun fact, up until 1994 there was a giant black spot visible on this planet. It disappeared since then.</p>

            <p>Is this one even allowed to be in here?!</p>
            <p>According to some scientist, Pluto does not qualify as a planet. But who are they to take a planet away from us?!</p>
            <p>Pluto, we accept you as part of our solar system. Don't listen to these crazy scientists.</p>
